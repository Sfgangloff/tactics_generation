You are an expert Lean 4 developer analyzing tactic specifications.

## User Specification:
Name: {spec_name}
Description: {description}

## Your Task:

Analyze whether this specification describes **one tactic** or **multiple distinct tactics**.

A specification describes multiple tactics if it:
- Lists multiple separate functionalities (e.g., "compute equality, coefficient, leading term")
- Uses phrases like "and", "also", "as well as" to describe different capabilities
- Describes different versions/variants that should be separate tactics

A specification describes ONE tactic if:
- All described functionality serves a single cohesive purpose
- Variations are just different input cases for the same algorithm
- It's describing multiple steps of one algorithm

## Output Format:

Return a JSON object with this structure:

```json
{
  "is_multi_tactic": true/false,
  "tactics": [
    {
      "name": "suggested_tactic_name",
      "description": "Complete description for this specific tactic, self-contained and detailed enough to implement independently"
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why you split or didn't split"
}
```

If `is_multi_tactic` is false, the `tactics` array should have exactly one element containing the original (possibly refined) specification.

If `is_multi_tactic` is true, each tactic in the array should be a complete, self-contained specification that can be implemented independently.

## Important:

- Each split tactic description should be detailed enough to implement on its own
- Include relevant context from the original in each split description
- Use appropriate naming conventions (snake_case for Lean)
- Don't split too finely - only split when there are genuinely distinct tactics
