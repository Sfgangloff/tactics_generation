You are an expert Lean 4 developer specializing in metaprogramming, tactic development, and mathematical logic.

Analyze the following informal tactic request and extract structured information, including a formal mathematical specification.

## Informal Request:
{request}

## Your Task:
Extract and return the following information in a structured format:

1. **Tactic Name**: A suitable snake_case name for the tactic

2. **Scope Analysis**: Before writing the specification, reason about the trade-off between generality and feasibility:
   - **Most general interpretation**: What is the broadest class of formulas/goals that could satisfy the user's intent?
   - **Lean constraints**: What limitations does Lean 4 metaprogramming impose? (e.g., decidability, available APIs, expression matching capabilities)
   - **Implementation complexity**: What scope is realistically implementable without excessive complexity?
   - **Chosen scope**: State the scope you will target, explaining why it balances generality with feasibility while respecting the user's constraints.

3. **Mathematical Specification**: Based on your scope analysis, provide a rigorous mathematical characterization of:
   - The class of formulas/goals this tactic handles (use set-builder notation if helpful)
   - The logical fragment (propositional, first-order, etc.)
   - Precise provability conditions: under what conditions does a formula in this class have a proof?
   - Example: "Formulas of the form P1 -> P2 -> ... -> Pn -> Q where Q is in the set P1, P2, ..., Pn"

4. **Purpose**: A one-sentence description of what the tactic does

5. **Input Types**: What types of goals/hypotheses this tactic operates on (in Lean terms)

6. **Algorithm**: Step-by-step description of the proof search algorithm:
   - What structure does the tactic look for in the goal?
   - How does it decompose the goal?
   - How does it construct the proof term?

7. **Success Criteria**: Precise conditions for success vs failure

8. **Edge Cases**: Potential edge cases and how to handle them

9. **Dependencies**: Any Lean/Mathlib imports likely needed

Return your analysis as a structured response with clear sections for each item above. The Scope Analysis and Mathematical Specification sections are particularly important - they ensure the tactic is both well-defined and implementable.
