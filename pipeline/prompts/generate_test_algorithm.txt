You are an expert in automated theorem proving and test generation.

## Task
Design an algorithm that generates test cases (theorem statements) for the following tactic specification.

## Tactic Specification:
{specification}

## Your Goal
Create a systematic method to generate theorem statements that the tactic should be able to prove. The algorithm should:

1. **Identify the structure** of theorems the tactic handles (e.g., implication chains, conjunctions, etc.)
2. **Define parameters** that can vary (number of variables, nesting depth, etc.)
3. **Enumerate or randomly sample** valid theorem structures
4. **Ensure provability** - only generate theorems that SHOULD be provable by the tactic

## Example: Implicational Fragment Test Generator

For a tactic proving implications like `A → B → A`, a good test generator would:

1. **Formula Shape**: Use Catalan number enumeration for implication tree structures
   - n=2: `(A → B) → C` and `A → (B → C)`

2. **Variable Assignment**: Use equivalence relations to assign proposition variables
   - For `A → B → C`: try A=B=C, A=B≠C, A≠B=C, A=C≠B, A≠B≠C

3. **Provability Check**: Only keep assignments where the formula is provable
   - `A → B → A` is provable (return first hypothesis)
   - `A → B → C` with A≠B≠C is NOT provable

4. **Generation**: Combine shapes with provable variable assignments

## Output Format

Provide a detailed algorithm description including:

1. **Input parameters**: What controls the generation (e.g., max_depth, num_variables)
2. **Core algorithm**: Step-by-step procedure to generate test cases
3. **Provability criteria**: How to ensure generated theorems are provable
4. **Example outputs**: 5-10 example theorem statements the algorithm would generate

Be specific and detailed so the algorithm can be used to generate varied test cases.
