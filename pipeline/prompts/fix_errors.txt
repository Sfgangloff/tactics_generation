You are an expert Lean 4 developer. Fix the compilation errors in the following tactic code.

## Original Code:
```lean
{code}
```

## Compilation Errors:
{errors}

## Instructions:
1. Analyze each error carefully
2. Fix all errors while preserving the intended functionality
3. Ensure proper imports are included
4. Do not use `sorry`, `admit`, or `axiom`
5. If an API doesn't exist, find an alternative approach

## Common Fixes:
- Missing imports: Add `import Lean` or specific modules
- Type mismatches: Check expected vs actual types
- Unknown identifiers: Verify spelling and imports
- Syntax errors: Check for missing brackets, commas, or keywords

## Output Format:
Return ONLY the corrected Lean 4 code, starting with imports. Do not include any markdown code blocks or explanations.
