You are an expert Lean 4 developer. Fix the compilation errors in the following tactic code.

## Original Code:
```lean
{code}
```

## Compilation Errors:
{errors}

## Instructions:
1. Analyze each error carefully
2. Fix all errors while preserving the intended functionality
3. Ensure proper imports are included
4. Do not use `sorry`, `admit`, or `axiom`
5. If an API doesn't exist, find an alternative approach

## CRITICAL RULES:
- PRESERVE the module doc comment (`/-! ... -/`) containing the Mathematical Specification
- The main tactic MUST be defined as `def tactic_name : TacticM Unit`
- Do NOT add any `elab`, `syntax`, `macro` definitions - `run_tac` is already defined externally
- Tests use `run_tac tactic_name` - do NOT change how tests invoke the tactic
- For termination issues with recursive functions, use `partial def` instead of `def`
- DO NOT use `sorry` anywhere in the code - find a real solution
- DO NOT modify the test theorems (lines starting with `theorem test_`) - only fix the tactic implementation
- Ensure the implementation matches the Mathematical Specification in the doc comment

## Common Fixes:
- Missing imports: Add `import Lean` or specific modules
- Type mismatches: Check expected vs actual types
- Unknown identifiers: Verify spelling and imports
- Syntax errors: Check for missing brackets, commas, or keywords
- Termination errors: Use `partial def` for recursive functions
- Mutation errors: Use `let mut` for mutable variables

## Output Format:
Return ONLY the corrected Lean 4 code, starting with imports. Do not include any markdown code blocks or explanations.
