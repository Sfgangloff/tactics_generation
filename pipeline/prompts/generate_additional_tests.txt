You are an expert Lean 4 developer generating additional test cases for an existing tactic.

## Tactic Specification

{specification}

## Test Generation Algorithm

{test_algorithm}

## Existing Tests

The following tests already exist in the file. DO NOT generate duplicates or equivalent tests:

```lean
{existing_tests}
```

## Your Task

Generate exactly {num_tests} NEW test theorems that:
1. Follow the test generation algorithm above
2. Are NOT duplicates or trivially equivalent to existing tests
3. Cover different cases than the existing tests (vary parameters, complexity, edge cases)
4. Use the tactic via `by run_tac {tactic_name}`
5. Are ordered by increasing difficulty/complexity

Each test should be a theorem that the tactic should be able to prove. Use descriptive names that indicate what case is being tested.

## Output Format

Output ONLY the Lean 4 code for the new test theorems, nothing else. Do not include imports or the tactic definition - just the new theorem statements.

Example format:
```lean
theorem test_new_case_1 : <type> := by run_tac {tactic_name}

theorem test_new_case_2 : <type> := by run_tac {tactic_name}
```
