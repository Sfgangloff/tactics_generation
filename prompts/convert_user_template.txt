Task ID: {task_id}

Translate the following Python LITERALLY to Lean 4, following ALL HARD CONSTRAINTS and STRICT RULES.

Python task description:
{text}

Python code:
{code}

Python test setup (if any):
{test_setup_code}

Python asserts:
{tests}

Challenge tests (if any):
{challenge_tests}

Deliver ONE JSON object:
- task_id: integer
- lean_module_name: "Task{task_id}"
- lean_code: Lean 4 code using ONLY the fixed header (Batteries/Std), no other imports, no IO/prints
- lean_tests: Lean 4 tests that mirror the Python asserts (deterministic; sort if Python used sets but order is asserted)
- notes: brief list of any absolutely necessary deviations (e.g., "sorted after dedup to match asserted order")

Sorting requirement: do not use any library sort. If you need a deterministic order,
inline the local `isort` helper (see rules) and call `isort (· ≤ ·) …`.

Here are a few examples to help you:
