You are an expert in automated theorem proving and test generation.

## Task
Generate {num_tests} test theorems for the following tactic, using the test generation algorithm provided.

## Tactic Name:
{tactic_name}

## Tactic Specification:
{specification}

## Test Generation Algorithm:
{test_algorithm}

## Requirements

1. Generate exactly {num_tests} DISTINCT test theorems - no duplicates allowed
2. Each test must be a theorem that the tactic SHOULD be able to prove
3. Order tests by difficulty: start with the simplest cases, end with the trickiest
4. Use different variable names across tests (A, B, C, P, Q, R, X, Y, Z, etc.)
5. Each theorem MUST use `run_tac {tactic_name}` as the proof

## Difficulty Progression

Structure your {num_tests} tests as follows:
- **First third**: Simplest cases (minimal variables, straightforward structure)
- **Middle third**: Medium complexity (more variables, deeper nesting)
- **Final third**: Tricky edge cases (maximum complexity the tactic should handle)

**IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:**
- ALL variables must be of type `Prop` (e.g., `A B C : Prop`) - do NOT use `Type`, `α`, `β`, etc.
- Do NOT use any Mathlib types (like `Set`, `Finset`, etc.)
- Stick to propositional logic formulas using the variables

## Output Format

Return ONLY Lean 4 code containing the test theorems. Format:

```lean
-- Test theorems for {tactic_name}

theorem test_1 (A B : Prop) : <simplest_formula> := by
  run_tac {tactic_name}

theorem test_2 (A B C : Prop) : <simple_formula> := by
  run_tac {tactic_name}

-- ... progressively harder ...

theorem test_{num_tests} (...) : <trickiest_formula> := by
  run_tac {tactic_name}
```

**CRITICAL:**
- ALL {num_tests} theorems must be UNIQUE - no two theorems should have the same formula
- You MUST use exactly `run_tac {tactic_name}` as the proof - this is the ONLY way to invoke the tactic
- Do NOT use any custom tactic syntax - the tactic is a TacticM function, not a registered tactic
- Do NOT define any syntax, elab, or macro - just write theorem statements
- Do NOT include any markdown code blocks or explanations

Return ONLY the Lean 4 theorem statements.
